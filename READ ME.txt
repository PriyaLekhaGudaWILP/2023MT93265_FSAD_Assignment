Frontend: Use React for building the UI.
Backend: Use .NET Framework for server-side logic.
Database: Use SQL Server or MongoDB depending on your preference.
REST APIs: Facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
Key Technologies:

React (Frontend)
.NET Web API (Backend)
SQL Server / MongoDB (Database)
Fetch API for integration

Steps to Implement the Backend:

User Authentication:

Implement authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Create API endpoints for:
User Registration (/api/users/register)
User Login (/api/users/login)

Book Listing:
Create models for User and Book.
Develop CRUD API endpoints:
Add Book: POST /api/book
Get Books: GET /api/book
Book Search:

Implement search filters with query parameters:
Example: GET /api/books?title=Harry Potter&genre=Fantasy&location=NY
Use pagination to handle large datasets.
Backend Code (Sample):

Models (Book.cs and User.cs)
Controller (BooksController.cs)
Database setup using Entity Framework (if SQL is chosen)
PART 3: Frontend (React)
Steps to Implement the Frontend:

User Authentication:

Use React Router for navigation (e.g., Login, Signup pages).
Create a form to handle user login and registration.
Manage tokens using localStorage or sessionStorage.
Book Listing:

Create a dashboard to display user-listed books.
Allow users to add/edit/delete books through a modal or form.
Book Search:

Implement a search bar and filters on the homepage.
Use React state and fetch API to display search results.
Frontend Code (Sample):

Components: AuthForm, BookList, SearchBar
State Management: React Context or Redux for global state
